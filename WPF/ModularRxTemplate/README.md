# ModularRxTemplate
Modular template for applications with Prism, ReactiveUI and built-in localization. Can be used to kick-start a new WPF application. 

This template includes techniques from these other samples:
- ExportToGlobalXamlNamespace
- ConverterAsMarkupExtension
- LocalizationWithResources

The purpose of this sample is not to explain Prism or ReactiveUI, but to serve as a clean and powerful starting point for new WPF applications.
